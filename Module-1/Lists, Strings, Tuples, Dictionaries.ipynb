    "Dictionaries can be looked at as lists with index values that can be non-numeric and elements are not automtically assigned with a numeric index value like in lists, strings, or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are used to hold a group of related information like records as opposed to putting information in a list or tuple like in data (Although there are reasons why sometimes data is stored in a tuple and sometimes it is in a dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a dictionary is:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "{key:value}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The **key** can be any non-dynamic data type meaning the value should be permanent and would not change such as an **integer**, **float**, **string**, and **tuple**. The value can be any valid data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The key should be unique and have no matching values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about dictionaries in the Python documentation here: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)"
